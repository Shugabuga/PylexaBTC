# PylexaSkill
#### *An example Amazon Alexa skill using Python and Pylexa.*

Note: This is a modified fork of [heroku/alexa-heroku-info](https://github.com/heroku/alexa-heroku-info).

## Introduction
This example skill will, when prompted, get the response of information provided by environmental variables, making it easier to kickstart making an Alexa skill. Very similar code is used in skills such as [National Parks](https://www.amazon.com/ShugaBuga-Development-National-Parks/dp/B0734LBNYX) and [Bitcoin Value](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0741N7SWN).

## Install to Heroku
To link the skill with Heroku, use the button below and fill out the variables:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

After this is done, you need to log in to your Amazon account and go  [here](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#/). After this is done, click `Get Started` under `Alexa Skills Kit`, click `Add a New Skill`, and fill in information under `Interaction Model` with info from the `/conf/` folder in this repository.
